To use it you have to install python on your computer:

- Windows : https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-amd64.exe

In order to get the app running you have to install some libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From terminal install :
- pip install pyserial
- pip install tk

With these two libraries the application should work.

For execute the program :
- open terminal (in windows can be PowerShell or Prompt )
- go to the directory where you have the python program downloaded
- use the command:  python program.py

If you want to modify something ,you can use your favourite IDE like VSCode (https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/d037ac076cee195194f93ce6fe2bdfe2969cc82d/VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.84.0.exe) or the one you prefer
