# usb-serial-project

The goal is to be able to select a txt file and send all the content via serial UART USB

To use it you have to install python on your computer:

- Windows : https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-amd64.exe

In order to get the app running you have to install some libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------

From terminal install :
- pip install pyserial
- pip install tkinter

With these two libraries the application should work.
